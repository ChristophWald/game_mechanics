I am interested in game mechanics as a way of creating patterns and I like to think about implementations and visualization of these.

Hus

Hus is part of the huge and old family of board cames called [Mancala](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mancala). I used to play it with my kids and wondered if it terminates always and how strategic gameplay would look like. 
Rules can be found for example [here] (https://www.helpster.de/hus-spielanleitung-fuer-dieses-steinchenspiel_86839).

I implemented the game mechanic as an exercise for creating visualizations and getting statistics from game mechanics. 

Next step: Polish the statistics. Develop and test strategies.

Carolus Magnus

[Carolus](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolus_Magnus_(Spiel)) Magnus is a board game from 2000, that seems to built upon some ideas from [El Grande](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Grande). The game mechanics are interacting in an intricate way e.g. by changing the board. 

I implemented the game mechanic as an exercise for object orientated modelling and until only tested if it terminates if played randomly. 

Next step: Develop visualization. Develop and test strategies.
