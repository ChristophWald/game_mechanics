I am interested in game mechanics as a way of creating patterns, and I enjoy thinking about their implementation and visualization.

### **Hus**

Hus is part of the large and ancient family of board games known as [Mancala](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mancala). I used to play it with my kids and began to wonder whether the game always terminates and what strategic gameplay might look like.  
Rules can be found, for example, [here](https://www.helpster.de/hus-spielanleitung-fuer-dieses-steinchenspiel_86839).

I implemented the game mechanics as an exercise in creating visualizations and collecting statistics based on gameplay.

**Next steps**: Refine the statistical analysis. Develop and test strategies.

### **Carolus Magnus**

[Carolus Magnus](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolus_Magnus_(Spiel)) is a board game from the year 2000 that appears to build on some ideas from [El Grande](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Grande). Its game mechanics interact in an intricate way, for example by dynamically changing the game board.

I implemented the game mechanics as an exercise in object-oriented modeling and, so far, have only tested whether it terminates when played randomly.

**Next steps**: Create a visualization. Develop and test strategies.
